# 📚 Graph Algorithms — Homework & Exercises

Welcome to my **Graph Algorithms** repository!
This repo contains my implementations, visualizations, and homework solutions for the Graph Algorithms course. All algorithms are written with clarity, correctness, and educational value in mind.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Repository

This repository is designed to:

* Collect all **homework solutions** for the course
* Provide **clean implementations** of classic graph algorithms
* Include **visualizations** (e.g., BFS/DFS animations, shortest-path demos)
* Serve as a reference for studying and revising graph theory concepts

---


## 💻 Code Style

All implementations follow these principles:

* Clear variable naming
* Step-by-step comments for understanding (i tried )
* Separation of logic and visualization
* Minimal dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run

Each folder contains its own instructions.

---

## 📌 Notes

This repository is mainly for learning and educational purposes.
If you're taking the same course, **do not copy solutions** blindly — understand them first!
